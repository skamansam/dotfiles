# dotfiles
Here be dragons. and dofiles. plenty of dotfiles

Here are some of my dotfiles. Browse them if you want. I make no warranty of anything whatsoever. Use at your own risk.

All that said, this repo is really just what a fresh install of linux should contain, for me.

* `setup.sh` - installs software
* `install.sh` - installs the symlinks for these files

## NOTES:

* I like to modularize things, so my profile and such is modularized, just like in Fedora. see `.profile.d`
